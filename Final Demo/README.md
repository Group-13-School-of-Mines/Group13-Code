# Final Demo
For the final, the bot will locate an aruco marker as quickly as it can, and then



#Don't forget!
open up the communication channel between the pi and the arduino by running:
`stty -F /dev/ttyACM0 raw 9600 && cat /dev/ttyACM0`

#Program flow:
Rotate bot until camera sees aruco
measure angle and rotate bot by that amount
go towards the marker until marker is within 1 foot
backup a small amount (if needed)
rotate 90 degrees
Circle the marker
